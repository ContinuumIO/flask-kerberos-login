Flask Kerberos Authentication
=============================

Based on [flask-kerberos](https://github.com/mkomitee/flask-kerberos). If you
only require Kerberos authentication, that library works great!

This library is meant to integrate with
[flask-login](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login) to avoid declaring
in the application code the dependency on Kerberos.
